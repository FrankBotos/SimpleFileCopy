# SimpleFileCopy
A simple C++ program that converts a file to binary, then makes an exact duplicate on the hard drive. It is a very simple program and it should be relatively easy to compile this as it stands without any dependencies whatsoever. Although it is a simple program I do believe that it can have some interesting applications where the transferring and copying of files is concerned.
